EllipsoidCalc
README
Fully functioning stand alone program (once exported to a runnable .jar file). This program calculates the volume of an ellipsoid (egg-shape) using the length of the axes and spherical coordinates as inputs. Knowledge of spherical coordinates is required to use the program. Accuracy is currently uncertain for radian values other than increments of π/2 for θ and φ.

To run application, navigate to the class named EllipsoidCalcMain and run it.
