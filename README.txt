EllipsoidCalc

README

Fully functioning stand-alone program (once exported to a runnable .jar file). This program calculates the volume of an ellipsoid (egg-shape) using the length of the axes and spherical coordinates as inputs. Knowledge of spherical coordinates is required to use the program. The Application uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the volume of the shape in most cases. The sample size is 10 million points. 

The algorithm is limited to 99.0% accuracy when the smallest axis is >=1 and 99.95% accuracy when the smallest axis is >= 10. This is limited due to the compromise between speed of the program and accuracy of the results. 

If the bounds of integration for φ and θ are increments of π/2, the calculation is very quick and accurate. If the axes are as follows:  a = b = c (a sphere is entered), the calculation is also very quick and accurate.

To run the application, navigate to the class named EllipsoidCalcMain and run it.
