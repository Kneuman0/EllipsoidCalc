EllipsoidCalc

README

Fully functioning stand-alone program (once exported to a runnable .jar file). This program calculates the volume of an ellipsoid (egg-shape) using the length of the axes and spherical coordinates as inputs. Knowledge of spherical coordinates is required to use the program. The Application uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the volume of the shape. The sample size is 7.5 million points. The accuracy is limited to +/- .01 due to the compromise between speed of the program and accuracy of the results. 
To run the application, navigate to the class named EllipsoidCalcMain and run it.
