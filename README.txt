EllipsoidCalc

README

Fully functioning stand-alone program (once exported to a runnable .jar file). This program calculates the volume of an ellipsoid (egg-shape) using the length of the axes and spherical coordinates as inputs. Knowledge of spherical coordinates is required to use the program. The Application uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the volume of the shape. The sample size is 7.5 million points. The accuracy is limited to +/- .01 due to the compromise between speed of the program and accuracy of the results. 
To run the application, navigate to the class named EllipsoidCalcMain and run it.

If you'd like to review the math, navigate to the Documentation and Notes on Math folder.
