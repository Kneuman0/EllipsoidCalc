EllipsoidCalc
README
Fully functioning stand alone program (once exported to a runnable .jar file). This program calculates the volume of an ellipsoid (egg-shape) using the length of the axes and spherical coordinates as inputs. Knowledge of spherical coordinates is required to use the program. I recently found that the algorithm is only accurate using increments of π/2 for θ and φ. Jacobian needs to be found using spherical coordinates for u, v and w.
To run application, navigate to the class named EllipsoidCalcMain and run it.
